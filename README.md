# &#x1F3BC; *OrgMaker 3*

**Fork of A music sequencer for retro video games**  

This does not use a MIDI device.  
This original library was created by [Studio Pixel](http://studiopixel.sakura.ne.jp/) in 1999, and was used in [Cave Story](https://www.cavestory.org/).

## &#x1F352; Introduction

For the '[STARGAZER](http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiss-me/aji/star/)' development, I inherited this library from [Studio Pixel](http://studiopixel.sakura.ne.jp/) in 2003.  
However, due to a change in my private life, it became inactive for a long time. On the other hand, the world expansion of Cave Story has increased the number of people requesting Organya.

Mastermind.

In 1999, Studio Pixel produced the song composition software Organya for "Cave Story".

>Basically an internal development tool, and not very general, occasionally people who say "I like the shabby sound for some reason" and even "I want to compose with that sound" call this tool perfect.

With the world knowing the development of "Cave Story", which increased the demand of Organya, and the same for the opinion for how to manage the source code, I have made the repository public.
